# Parsing Data-Dependent Grammars using Derivatives

This is a presentation and supporting code for a summer seminar talk I gave at
[the programming languages research group in Delft](https://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/).

The basic idea of recognizing context-free grammars using derivatives has been
taken from Oleg Grenrus' blog post: [Fix-ing Regular
Expressions](https://well-typed.com/blog/2020/06/fix-ing-regular-expressions/).
I extend his approach by adding parsing and data-dependency, as described in
Afroozeh and Izmaylova's paper [One Parser to Rule them
All](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/24027/24027B.pdf).
